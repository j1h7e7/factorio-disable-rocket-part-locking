# What?

Maraxis and Muluna mods disable the use of alternate recipes for rocket parts.
This mod fixes that

# Why?

Because I wanted to be able to use alternate rocket part recipes. I didn't make this a PR to the original mods since there are two mods, and the solution I came up with isn't the cleanest and could potentially be abused
